The input instructions are listed above the search bar. Major cities around the world can be searched just using the city name. For smaller cities, to search within the United States use 'city name (,) two letter state (,) US' must be used. For non-US locations city (,) country code must be used. If user is unsure of a country code a link to all country codes is provided on the page. 

When a city is searched a button is dynamically created that appears under the search button. These created buttons can be used to go back and look at previously searched cities. The buttons shown in the image are all previously searched cities and can be used to easily access the weather of those cities. Just click and all the information will repopulate.
